Your API key carries all your privileges, so keep it secure and don't share it with anyone.

### Fetch Incidents:
The generated incidents are notifications from vt-premium-notifications-list.
Use "Tag" to filter which notification tag to get. 
For example, using the "malicious_executables" will fetch only notifications about malicious executables.
